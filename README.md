# Smart-Recipe-Suggester

## Overview
The Recipe Suggester is a Python-based tool that helps users find recipes based on available ingredients. It suggests possible dishes, highlights missing ingredients, and provides cooking instructions for selected recipes.

## Features
- Reads recipes from a CSV file.
- Matches user-provided ingredients with available recipes.
- Suggests recipes that can be made with minimal missing ingredients.
- Provides cooking instructions for selected recipes.
- Suggests additional ingredients to shop for if no complete recipes match.

## Requirements

4. Place your recipe dataset (CSV file) in the appropriate directory.

## Usage
1. Run the script using:
   ```sh
